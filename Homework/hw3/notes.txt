genfromtxt:
    - use this to get both data and headers
    - getting headers messes up formatting
        - use data.view((int, # of columns)) to fix this
    - can get list of col names from data.dtype.names

from_structure:
    - takes data and names from genfromtxt
    - "structure" is a given weird formatted tuple (from Tetrad)
    - Skip a bunch of optional params

util_map:
    - dictionary of dictionaries
        - dict1 = {parents of util node: dict2,...}
        - dict2 = {value of parent node: utility score,...}
    - we have to assign utility to values of parents of utility node
    - get this data from Tetrad i guess?

decide:
    - generate all possible permutations of dec_var values
    - score each permutation, return one with best EU
